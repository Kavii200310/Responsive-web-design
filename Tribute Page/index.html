           <h2> Who was Che Guevara?

           </h2> <br><br>
                <ul><li> "Che" Guevara (1928–1967) was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist. A major figure in the Cuban Revolution, his image has become a symbol of rebellion, socialism, and resistance against imperialism</li><br><br>
                </ul>
                    <h2>Early Life:</h2><br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Born in Rosario, Argentina, Che Guevara studied medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. During his travels across Latin America as a young medical student, he witnessed the deep poverty, hunger, and disease that inspired his revolutionary ideology</li><br><br>
                
                 </ul>
            <h2>Role in the Cuban Revolution:</h2><br><br>
               <ul>  <li>Che joined Fidel Castro's movement to overthrow Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. As a key commander, he led guerrilla forces in significant battles and helped implement socialist reforms post-revolution.</li><br><br>
               </ul>
               <h2>Post-Cuba Revolutionary Efforts:</h2><br><br>
                
               <ul><li>After the Cuban Revolution, Che sought to spread revolution globally. He fought in the Congo and later in Bolivia, where he was captured and executed by the Bolivian military in 1967.</li><br><br>
               </ul>
               <h2>Legacy and Symbolism:</h2><br><br>
               <ul><li>Che's life and ideals have been celebrated and criticized globally. He is admired by many as a symbol of anti-imperialism and social justice, while others view his legacy as controversial due to the methods employed in his revolutionary campaigns.</li><br><br>
                <li>His iconic photograph by Alberto Korda, often referred to as "Guerrillero Heroico," remains a global symbol of revolution and resistance</li><br><br>
               </ul> 
            
            
            </ul> <br><br>
            <div>
            <p>More than attacking history, he conquered it by force of courage, principles, and example. Ernesto Guevara, for all of us our Che, is one of those men we can love infinitely, not only for the Cuban Revolution that he helped to birth, make, and consolidate but also for that aroma of integrity, determination, discipline with the task, with the work entrusted to him, with his condition and always, as a combatant. <br> <br>

                The days of October 8 and 9, 1967, fix the memory of his last breath in the little School of La Higuera, Bolivia, with his long hair and rebellious beard, his feet almost bare because of the worn boots and that strength in his gaze that made more than one soldier doubt the shot that did not deserve to come from those rifles. <br> <br>
                
                Only an order of hate and rage brought down his physique. And right there, the Che of America was reborn, the symbol for generations of young people around the world. 57 years later, his figure does not seem stuck in the past, but rather elevated in the present, like a beacon of light to fight the same injustices and abuses, the same imperialism to which we must not give “even a little bit.” <br> <br>
                
                His bond with Cuban workers since 1959 bore the imprint of overcoming the impossible. Rarely has a leader been seen to better understand a worker after sweating profusely carrying sacks, cutting sugar cane, innovating in a factory, or simply, eating the same lunch in the dining room. That was Che. That is how we all feel. <br> <br>
                
                
               <i> If that is not love, what else can define such revolutionary passion? His example always teaches people how much we all need to be the new man he was </i>
